# Film Log Pocket

My latest attempt at making a portable HTML-download logging application for exposed rolls of film.

I was inspired when I used [Treasury Direct](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/BC/SBCPrice) to calculate how much bonds my parents had purchased for me in the 90s. There is an option to download your table of bonds, and also allowing you to add more when/if you open up the HTML file in the browser. [Reference their tutorial on saving](https://treasurydirect.gov/indiv/help/bc/bc-savings-help/).

The idea of making the app portable is letting the user move the data around any device they decide to view it.
